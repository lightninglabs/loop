# Loop Client Release Notes

#### New Features

* Instant Out now validates server invoices against a caller-approved maximum
  swap fee.

#### Breaking Changes

* Instant Out requests must now set `max_swap_fee_sat`. Requests that omit the
  fee cap are rejected; an explicit zero cap remains valid. Direct users of
  `Manager.NewInstantOut` must pass the fee cap as a required argument.

#### Bug Fixes

* Instant Out now attempts to cancel server-side swaps when client
  initialization fails, allowing locked reservations to be released without
  waiting for the server timeout.

* Static-address loop-in quotes and manual outpoint initiation now reject
  deposits that are too close to expiry before contacting the Loop server.

* Static Address deposit reconciliation now preserves authoritative
  first-confirmation heights while lnd is catching up, preventing premature
  expiry decisions from mismatched wallet and block-notification heights.

* Rapid reservation funding confirmations no longer cause initialization to
  time out while waiting for an intermediate client state.

* Loop In commands now parse `--route_hints` as a single JSON array and pass
  every route and hop through unchanged.

* `loopd --version` inside the official Docker images now reports the commit
  it was built from instead of an empty string.

* The official `linux/arm64` Docker images now contain arm64 binaries and an
  arm64 userspace. Every published platform was previously built for amd64, so
  `loopd` failed with `exec format error` on ARM hosts.

#### Maintenance

* The Docker image build now verifies that every platform of the image index
  holds binaries for the architecture it advertises, and gives a release its
  tag only once that check has passed.
