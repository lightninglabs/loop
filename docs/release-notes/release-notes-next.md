#### Bug Fixes

* The static address Loop In timeout sweep now spends the exact HTLC output
  confirmed on chain, including server-published backup fee variants.
  Previously it always targeted the standard fee variant, so a confirmed high
  fee or extremely high fee HTLC transaction could not be swept back after the
  HTLC timed out. Sweeps that would leave a dust output are no longer signed.
